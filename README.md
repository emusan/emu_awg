#FPGA Function Gen

NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS BY NO MEANS COMPLETE, THERE IS SOME TERRIBLE CODE IN HERE, LOOK AT YOUR OWN RISK!

This is just a simple function generator implemented in VHDL targeting a Xilinx Spartan 3E FPGA.

It uses digital direct synthesis (DDS) to obtain a waveform from a look up table of values stored in RAM.

This was tested on the Digilient spartan 3E starter board.
